We are now credibly informed that there is a Steam Engine now preparing to run against any mare, horse or gelding that may be produced at next October Meeting at Newmarket; the wagers at present are stated to be 10,000l; the engine is the favourite. The extraordinary effects of mechanical powers is already known to the world; but the novelty, singularity, and powerful application against time and speed has created admiration in the minds of every scientific man. TREVITHICK, the proprietor and patentee of this engine, has been applied to by  several distinguished personages to exhibit this engine to the Public, previous to its being sent to Newmarket; we have not heard this gentleman's determination yet; its greatest speed well be 20 miles in one hour, and its slowest rate will never be less than 15 miles.

The Steam Engine, mentioned in our Paper of Thursday Last, to run at Newmarket next October Meeting, will be completed this week, and exhibited to the Public in fields adjoining the Bedford Nursery, near Tottenham-court-road, of which due notice will be given in this Paper.

RACING STEAM ENGINE - This Machine will exhibit its power of speed in a few days on Lady Southampton's estate, adjoining the New Road, St. Pancras, previous to going to Newmarket; will commence on Tuesday morning next, at eleven o'clock - Tickets of admission, 5s. each may be had at the following places - of Mr. Stott, No. 113, Newgate-street; Mr. Holden, British Museum, Queen street Bloomsbury; Mr. Drake, Eagle, Mile End; Mr Windsor, Narrow-street, Limehouse; Mr. Anderson, Lamb's Conduit-street; Mr. Way, Carpenter's Coffee-house, Covent-garden; Mr. Whitaker, Burton Ale-house, Gray's inn-lane; Mr. Wilson, Magdalen, Pimlico; Mr. Faibourn, New Compton-street, Soho; Mr. Field, Spur Inn, Borough; Mr. Fanton, Prince William Henry, Blackfriars-road; Bodenham, Worcester Coffee house, Oxford-road; Coach and Horses, Strand; Black Bear, Piccadilly; Golden Cross, Charing-cross; and at the Orange Tree, St. Pancras-road, near the spot.

The most astonishing machine ever invented is a steam engine with four wheels so constructed that she will with ease and without any further aid, gallop from 15 to 20 miles and hour on any circle. She weighs 8 tons and is matched for the next Newmarket meeting against three horses to run 24 hours starting the same time. She is now in training on Lady Southampton's estate adjoining the New-road near Bedford Nursery, St. Pancras. We understand that she will be exposed for Public inspection on Tuesday next.

RACING-STEAM ENGINE - This surprising Engine will commence to exhibit her power of speed to the Public This Day, at 11 o'clock, and will continue her experiments only a few days. Tickets of admission, 5s. each may be had at the Bar of all the coffee houses in London; and at the Orange Tree, New-road, St. Pancras.

RACING-STEAM ENGINE - The Public are respectfully informed that the exhibition of this machine, which was to have taken place this day, is unavoidably postponed till Monday next, the ground under the Railway, on which it was to run, being too soft and spongy, requiring additional support of timber.

TREVITHICK's TRAVELLING MACHINE WITHOUT HORSES, impelled by Steam. - This extraordinary Machine is now exhibiting opposite the End of Gower-street, close to the New Road; which with its contents, weighing eight tons, is matched to a travel more miles in twenty four hours than any horse in England can be found to perform. This Machine is now actually running, and will continue to do so for a few days previous to the performance of the match. Admittance 2s. The exhibition is open from ten till dusk.

EXTRAORDINARY WAGER. - It has been some time announced, that the NEW MACHINE for travelling without horses, being impelled entirely by STEAM, was matched to run twenty-four hours against any horse in the kingdom. This bet, so novel in the sporting world, will be decided on Wednesday and Thursday next. The machine is to start at two o'clock on Wednesday, on its ground in the fields, near Russell-square, to demonstrate the extent of its speed and continuance. It is calculated that the machine, though weighing eight tons, will travel 240 miles, at least within the time limited. -Very large sums are depending on the issue.

LOCOMOTIVE CARRIAGES<br>
(From a Correspondent.)<br>
Public opinion seems to have gone considerably astray with respect to the late trials of these machines on the Manchester rail-road. It too often happens that results alone are regarded, and causes and circumstances altogether overlooked. Probably a more striking instance of this cannot be given than the following fact, within the recollection of thousands. Just after the invention of steam-carriage which has been in use for the last 20 years on our Railways, Mr. Trevithick publicly exhibited it for months on a circular rail-road, constructed on purpose in the Bedford nursery grounds, now Euston-square. He also, on 3d of August in the same year, ran it and won a large bet, against a race-horse. Hereupon public expectation rose to a high pitch: nothing less was talked or thought of than the immediate application of steam locomotives to our common roads. It was however found, that, this carriage, which would draw an immense weight on a rail-road and outstrip the fleetest horses, lay like a log when transferred to a common road, and could not move even itself. Indeed, the difficulties to contend with in applying locomotive carriages to our turnpike roads are altogether of a different description. The evenness and hardness of an iron surface, and the generally level character of a rail-road, render weight of little value, whilst the "bite of the wheels" being considerable, permits great effects to power. On the contrary, in common, roads the least resistance holds a large proportion to the weight, and of course a much larger to the bite. In going up a hill, the obstacles to overcome increase much, whilst the bite, the fulcrum on while the power acts, diminishes. So, to ensure success on our turnpike roads, it comes necessary to combine extreme strength with extremes to have power at will without encumbrance; and to possess some means of augmenting the bite in proportion. The commonest capacity must perceive the difficulty of incorporating such clashing qualities, and hence the wide difference between making a carriage to go on a rail and on a turnpike road. A carriage, which on a common road would run eight or ten miles an house with a ton or two after it, would take fours times the weight, at four times the speed, on a railway; whereas speed and power on the latter, as in the case of Mr. Trevithick's engine, are by no means a poof that the machine could moves on an ordinary road.

"Trevithick and Vivian erected several of their high pressure engines in Wales and other places, and it was about this time, although we do not know whether before or after the experiment at Merthyr Tydvil tramroad, that Trevithick put into operation the first locomotive engine in London. In the great metropolis Trevithick found ample support in his countrymen, Davies Gilbert, the Earl of Stanhope, Mr. Isaac Rogers, Mr. Samuel Rehe, Mr. Henry Clarke, and others connected with his native country or the cause of science. The engine he used was about the size of an orchestra drum, and which he attached to a phaeton between the back wheels. With this carriage an experiment was made in Lord's cricket ground, at Marylebone, several men of science alternately steering it, and expressing their perfect satisfaction as to the ease with which it was directed. From hence it was steered down the New Road, and Gray's Inn Lane, to the coach-builder, whence the phaeton was obtained. Thus, it passed over ground since the site of Hancock's experiments, and perhaps ultimately destined to be witness of the final triumph of this branch of locomotion. The next day Trevithick took this same engine and exhibited it in a cutler's shop, working the machinery; which was one of his essays, to show its general applicability. Subsequently he had a temporary tramroad constructed within an enclosure on the ground now occupied by Euston Square. This road was of an elliptical form, and on it he ran his locmotive. It was opened to the public as an exhibition, and people crowded to see it, but the second day Trevithick in his usual freaks, removed the engine, and, to great disappointment of the visitants, closed the ground. This he did under the impression that it was better to let the affair drop, until he saw the opportunity to avail himself of it advantageously.
